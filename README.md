## ANIMATED MAP FOR COVID-19 EVOLUTION WITH STATA

In this assignment, we create a data visualization map (Figure 1) which shows the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 for each country in the world on november 18,
2020 and an animated map to illustrate the evolution of the epidemic overtime. This static map is created using two commands which are _spshape2dta_ and _spmap_ and the animated map is generated using the _ffmpeg_ free package.
